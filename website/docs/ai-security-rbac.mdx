# AI Security & RBAC

## Access Model

- Viewer/Developer/Admin can use AI chat features.
- Only Developer/Admin can confirm executable proposals.

## Workspace Isolation

All AI entities are workspace-scoped:

- settings
- secrets
- MCP servers
- conversations/messages
- tool traces
- action proposals

## Secret Handling

- Secrets are encrypted at rest using `AI_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`.
- Raw secret values are never returned by APIs.
- Environment variable fallback is supported.

## Proposal Confirmation

Executable SQL/dbt proposals are single-action records with status lifecycle:

- `pending`
- `executed`
- `rejected`
- `expired`

No proposal executes without explicit confirmation.

## Auditing

AI interactions persist:

- prompts/responses
- tool traces
- proposal creation and resolution events
