# Analytics setup (optional)

dbt-Workbench includes optional Google Analytics 4 tracking. The GA script is only injected when `GA4_ID` is defined at build time.

## Add GA4_ID in GitHub Actions

1. Open your GitHub repository settings.
2. Navigate to **Secrets and variables → Actions**.
3. Add a new repository secret named `GA4_ID`.
4. Set the value to your GA4 Measurement ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`).

## Verify it works

- Trigger a new build by pushing to `main`.
- Inspect the rendered HTML for the GA script.
- Confirm real-time events in the GA4 console.

## Optional: Search console verification tags

You can inject verification meta tags at build time with GitHub Actions secrets:

- `GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` → renders `<meta name="google-site-verification" ...>`
- `BING_SITE_VERIFICATION` → renders `<meta name="msvalidate.01" ...>`

Add these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** to enable ownership verification in
Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
