# air-gapped dbt operations

The **air-gapped dbt** deployment model is a first-class scenario for dbt-Workbench. The UI is designed for **on-prem dbt UI** and **offline dbt UI** installations where outbound network access is restricted or fully disabled.

## Operational guidance

- **Artifact mounting:** keep `manifest.json`, `run_results.json`, `catalog.json`, and docs assets mounted locally.
- **Database configuration:** set `SQL_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_URL` and dbt profiles inside the secure environment.
- **Auth hardening:** enable JWT authentication, rotate secrets, and use RBAC to enforce least privilege.
- **Plugin opt-out:** set `PLUGIN_SYSTEM_ENABLED=false` to disable plugin discovery in minimal installations.
- **Update cadence:** manually sync new builds and artifacts using offline delivery mechanisms.

## On-prem checklist

1. Store dbt artifacts on local disks or approved shared storage.
2. Configure service users for warehouse connections with minimal privileges.
3. Disable external integrations that require outbound HTTP.
4. Document change control for artifacts and environment settings.
