# dbt artifacts viewer

The **dbt artifacts viewer** in dbt-Workbench reads your dbt artifacts so lineage, runs, catalog metadata, and docs previews stay in sync. Keep artifacts current to ensure the UI reflects the latest project state.

## Required artifacts

Mount the following files into the `DBT_ARTIFACTS_PATH` directory:

- `manifest.json`
- `run_results.json`
- `catalog.json`

## Docs assets

If you run `dbt docs generate`, include the generated `index.html` and assets alongside the artifacts. dbt-Workbench will host the docs viewer directly from these files.

## How artifacts are used

| Artifact | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `manifest.json` | Model lineage, compiled SQL, dependencies |
| `run_results.json` | Run history, statuses, and logs |
| `catalog.json` | Catalog metadata, column statistics, freshness |
| Docs assets | dbt docs viewer UI |
