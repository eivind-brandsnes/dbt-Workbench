# dbt column lineage

dbt-Workbench provides **dbt column lineage** by combining metadata from `manifest.json` and `catalog.json`. This lets you trace field-level dependencies across models, sources, and exposures without manual mapping.

## How column lineage is derived

- **manifest.json** supplies compiled SQL and dependency metadata.
- **catalog.json** supplies column-level metadata, types, and exposure details.
- The UI joins both artifacts to render column-to-column relationships.

## Performance modes

Column lineage can be tuned for performance using `LINEAGE_PERFORMANCE_MODE`:

- **fast**: prioritize quick graph loads for large projects.
- **balanced**: default mode for most deployments.
- **detailed**: deepest column lineage with richer relationships.

You can also toggle `LOAD_COLUMN_LINEAGE_BY_DEFAULT` to load model lineage first and switch to column lineage on demand.

## Troubleshooting column lineage

| Issue | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Column lineage missing | `catalog.json` not mounted | Ensure `catalog.json` is present in the artifacts path. |
| Graph loads slowly | Large project size | Switch to `fast` or reduce initial depth. |
| Columns missing from nodes | Incomplete docs artifacts | Regenerate artifacts with `dbt docs generate`. |
| No column lineage at all | Manifest missing | Verify `manifest.json` is mounted alongside catalog artifacts. |
