# Environment management

dbt-Workbench centralizes dbt profile settings and environment targets. Environments are used by run orchestration and the scheduler to ensure consistent execution.

## What environments control

- Active dbt profiles and targets.
- Connection details for the SQL workspace.
- Environment-specific run settings and credentials.

## Profile management

- View configured dbt profiles and available targets.
- Add a new profile with a YAML snippet that merges into `profiles.yml`.
- Edit the full `profiles.yml` inline for advanced changes.
