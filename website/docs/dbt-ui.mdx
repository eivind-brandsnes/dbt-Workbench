# dbt UI guide: what it is and how dbt-Workbench delivers it

A **dbt UI** is the control plane that makes dbt project metadata, lineage, and run operations visible in one place. dbt-Workbench is purpose-built to deliver that experience locally or inside restricted infrastructure. It pairs a data catalog, run history, and SQL workspace with strict workspace scoping so teams can explore models safely without vendor lock-in.

## What a dbt UI typically covers

A complete dbt UI focuses on four workflows:

1. **Artifacts and documentation visibility** — surface models, sources, tests, docs, and compiled SQL.
2. **Lineage insight** — show how models and columns connect across the project.
3. **Run orchestration** — run commands, monitor logs, and review run outputs.
4. **Operational governance** — schedule runs, manage environments, and secure access.

## How dbt-Workbench maps to those workflows

- **Lineage visualization:** deterministic D3/dagre layout, grouping controls, and impact highlighting. See the [dbt lineage visualization](/docs/lineage-overview/) page.
- **Column lineage:** column-level graph derived from manifest and catalog artifacts. Learn more in the [dbt column lineage](/docs/column-lineage/) guide.
- **Run orchestration:** execution buttons, log streaming, and run history. See [dbt run orchestration](/docs/run-orchestration/).
- **Scheduler:** cron-style schedules with retries, notifications, and diagnostics. Review the [dbt scheduler](/docs/scheduler/).
- **Catalog and docs:** search metadata, test health, and docs previews. Visit the [dbt catalog viewer](/docs/catalog/) and [dbt docs viewer](/docs/docs-viewer/).
- **SQL workspace:** dual-pane compiled SQL and safe execution. Explore the [dbt SQL workspace](/docs/sql-workspace/).

## Hosted vs self-hosted dbt UI (vendor lock-in avoidance)

Hosted dbt UI services prioritize convenience but can introduce vendor lock-in, forced upgrades, and restricted network access. A self-hosted dbt UI like dbt-Workbench offers:

- Full control over artifacts, databases, and credentials.
- Support for local, on-prem, and air-gapped operations.
- Workspace isolation with strict path scoping to reduce data leakage.
- Optional authentication and RBAC tailored to regulated environments.

If you need compliance controls or offline deployments, start with the [air-gapped and on-prem dbt UI](/docs/air-gapped-on-prem/) guidance.

## Typical dbt-Workbench workflows

- **Inspect the latest artifacts** in the [dbt artifacts viewer](/docs/artifacts/) and verify docs assets.
- **Validate model coverage** in the [dbt catalog viewer](/docs/catalog/).
- **Trigger a run** from the [dbt run orchestration](/docs/run-orchestration/) page and watch logs stream.
- **Schedule recurring runs** using the [dbt scheduler](/docs/scheduler/) with timezone-aware cron.
- **Use compiled SQL** in the [dbt SQL workspace](/docs/sql-workspace/) for safe warehouse querying.

## FAQ

### Is this dbt Cloud?
No. dbt-Workbench is a self-hosted dbt UI designed for local, on-prem, and air-gapped deployments without vendor lock-in.

### Can it run air-gapped?
Yes. dbt-Workbench supports offline deployments by mounting artifacts and disabling optional plugins or networked integrations.

### Does it support multi-project workspaces?
Yes. Multiple workspaces are supported with strict path scoping and isolated repositories, artifacts, and settings.

### Which dbt artifacts does the UI use?
The UI reads `manifest.json`, `run_results.json`, and `catalog.json` plus docs generate assets for previews.

### Is there an authentication option?
JWT authentication with role-based access control is available and optional. Default mode is open for local use.

### What workflows can I run from the UI?
Run dbt commands, inspect compiled SQL, browse catalogs, visualize lineage, manage environments, and schedule runs.
