# dbt SQL workspace

The **dbt SQL workspace** in dbt-Workbench is built for safe warehouse querying. It emphasizes **compiled SQL** only, with a dual-pane experience that keeps model source separate from the dbt model compiled SQL that is actually executed.

## Key capabilities

- **Dual-pane editor**: model source on the left, compiled SQL on the right.
- **Compiled SQL only** execution for dbt model runs.
- **Guardrails** for destructive queries with role-based access.
- **Profiling** on every query to surface column statistics.
- **Pagination** to keep large results responsive.

## Execution modes

1. **Custom SQL** — freeform queries against the selected environment, honoring destructive-query guardrails.
2. **dbt models** — execute the compiled SQL generated for a model, never the raw Jinja source.

If compiled artifacts are missing, the UI prompts a refresh before execution.
