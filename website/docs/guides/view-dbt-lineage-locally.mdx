# How to view dbt lineage locally

Use this guide to render dbt lineage visualization from local artifacts.

## Steps

1. Run dbt to generate `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` in `target/`.
2. Mount the artifacts into dbt-Workbench (`DBT_ARTIFACTS_PATH`).
3. Open the **Lineage** page and select a model.
4. Toggle column lineage for field-level tracing.
