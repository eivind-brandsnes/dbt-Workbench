# How to mount dbt artifacts into a UI

Use this guide to connect dbt artifacts to dbt-Workbench so the UI stays current.

## Steps

1. Generate artifacts with dbt (`manifest.json`, `run_results.json`, `catalog.json`).
2. Mount the `target/` directory into the container (`/app/dbt_artifacts`).
3. Run `dbt docs generate` and keep docs assets alongside the artifacts.
4. Reload dbt-Workbench to confirm metadata updates.
