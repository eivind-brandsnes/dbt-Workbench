# How to manage multiple dbt projects in one instance

Use workspaces to isolate artifacts, repositories, and settings per dbt project.

## Steps

1. Set `GIT_REPOS_BASE_PATH` to a shared base directory.
2. Create or connect workspaces in the UI.
3. Switch the active workspace to load a different project.
4. Verify strict path scoping for file operations.
