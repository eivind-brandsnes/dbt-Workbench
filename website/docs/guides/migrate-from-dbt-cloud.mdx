# Migrate from dbt Cloud to dbt-Workbench

Moving from dbt Cloud to dbt-Workbench gives you full control over your data infrastructure while eliminating vendor lock-in and reducing costs. This guide walks through the complete migration process.

## Why migrate from dbt Cloud?

Teams consider migrating from dbt Cloud for several reasons:

### Cost savings

SaaS pricing scales with usage. For growing teams with many developers and frequent runs, self-hosting can reduce costs significantly.

### Data sovereignty

Keep all data and metadata within your network perimeter. Critical for regulated industries and organizations with strict data governance policies.

### Customization and extensibility

Modify, extend, and integrate dbt-Workbench with your internal tools. The plugin system and open API enable workflows impossible in SaaS products.

### Air-gapped operations

Run dbt completely offline in secure environments without internet access.

## Migration overview

The migration process involves six main phases:

1. **Export** — Download your dbt Cloud project and artifacts
2. **Setup** — Install dbt-Workbench in your environment
3. **Transfer** — Move project files and configurations
4. **Configure** — Set up connections, profiles, and environment variables
5. **Validate** — Test all functionality before switching
6. **Automate** — Recreate schedules and notifications

## Phase 1: Export from dbt Cloud

### Download your dbt project

1. Navigate to your dbt Cloud project
2. Go to the IDE or repository section
3. Clone or download the complete repository including:
   - `models/` directory
   - `tests/` directory
   - `macros/` directory
   - `dbt_project.yml`
   - `packages.yml` (if using packages)
   - Any custom configurations

### Export artifacts (optional)

If you want historical lineage data:

1. Download recent `manifest.json`, `catalog.json`, and `run_results.json` files
2. These help maintain lineage continuity during the transition

### Document environment configurations

Record from dbt Cloud:
- Environment variables
- Database connection settings
- dbt profiles configurations
- Any custom macros or packages
- Schedule configurations (cron expressions)

## Phase 2: Set up dbt-Workbench

### Quick local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbt-workbench/dbt-Workbench.git
cd dbt-Workbench
docker-compose up --build
```

This launches the complete stack at http://localhost:3000.

### Production deployment

For production environments, review:
- [Air-gapped and on-prem guide](/docs/air-gapped-on-prem/)
- [Enable JWT authentication](/docs/guides/enable-jwt-auth/)
- [Configure RBAC](/docs/auth-rbac/)

## Phase 3: Transfer your project

### Move project files

Place your dbt project in the appropriate directory:

```
dbt-Workbench/
├── backend/
│   └── data/
│       └── repos/
│           └── default/           # Your project goes here
│               ├── dbt_project.yml
│               ├── models/
│               ├── tests/
│               └── macros/
```

### Transfer artifacts

Copy your exported artifacts to the artifacts directory:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/exported/target/* dbt-Workbench/sample_artifacts/
```

The backend will automatically detect and load these artifacts.

## Phase 4: Configure connections

### Set up dbt profiles

In dbt-Workbench, navigate to **Environments** and configure your database connections:

1. Add your warehouse credentials
2. Set up targets (dev, staging, production)
3. Configure connection-specific variables

### Environment variables

Transfer environment variables from dbt Cloud to dbt-Workbench:

```bash
# .env file or docker-compose environment
DBT_PROJECT_PATH=./dbt_project
DBT_ARTIFACTS_PATH=./dbt_project/target
POSTGRES_HOST=your-postgres-host
POSTGRES_USER=your-user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Install dbt packages

If your project uses dbt packages:

```bash
cd backend/data/repos/default
dbt deps
```

## Phase 5: Validate the migration

### Test dbt commands

Run key dbt commands to ensure everything works:

```bash
dbt debug        # Verify connections
dbt compile      # Test compilation
dbt run          # Run models
dbt test         # Run tests
dbt docs generate # Generate documentation
```

### Verify in the UI

Check that dbt-Workbench shows:
- All models in the lineage view
- Proper column lineage
- Documentation renders correctly
- Run history appears

### Test key workflows

Validate your team's critical workflows:
- Model development cycle
- Testing and validation
- Documentation updates
- Scheduled runs

## Phase 6: Set up automation

### Migrate schedules

Convert dbt Cloud job schedules to dbt-Workbench cron expressions:

| dbt Cloud Schedule | Cron Expression |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` |
| Daily at 9 AM | `0 9 * * *` |
| Every 15 minutes | `*/15 * * * *` |
| Weekly on Monday | `0 9 * * 1` |

Create schedules in the UI:
1. Go to **Scheduler**
2. Click **New Schedule**
3. Enter cron expression
4. Select environment and dbt command
5. Configure notifications

### Set up notifications

Configure Slack, email, or webhook notifications for run completion and failures:

```bash
# Environment variables
NOTIFICATIONS_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.your-domain.com
NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_FROM=dbt-alerts@your-domain.com
```

### Enable monitoring

Set up health checks and monitoring:
- API health endpoint: `/health`
- Log aggregation for troubleshooting
- Metrics collection for performance monitoring

## Post-migration checklist

- [ ] All models run successfully
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Lineage displays correctly
- [ ] Documentation is accessible
- [ ] Schedules execute on time
- [ ] Notifications work
- [ ] Team members can access the UI
- [ ] Authentication/authorization configured (if needed)
- [ ] Backups configured
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Connection failures

**Issue:** Database connections fail after migration

**Solution:** Verify connection strings, credentials, and network access. Use `dbt debug` to test connections.

### Missing packages

**Issue:** dbt packages not installed

**Solution:** Run `dbt deps` in the project directory after transferring files.

### Environment variables not set

**Issue:** Variables referenced in models not available

**Solution:** Ensure all environment variables from dbt Cloud are defined in dbt-Workbench configuration.

### Schedule timezone issues

**Issue:** Schedules run at wrong times

**Solution:** Verify `SCHEDULER_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` matches your expected timezone (default is UTC).

## FAQ

### Is it difficult to migrate from dbt Cloud?

Migration is straightforward since both use standard dbt projects. The main tasks are transferring files, configuring connections, and recreating schedules. Most teams complete migration in 1-2 days.

### Will I lose any features moving to dbt-Workbench?

dbt-Workbench covers the core dbt Cloud features including lineage, scheduling, documentation, and run history. Some enterprise SaaS features may differ, but the core workflows remain.

### Can I run both in parallel during migration?

Yes. You can operate dbt Cloud and dbt-Workbench simultaneously during the transition period to ensure nothing breaks before fully switching over.

### What about my dbt Cloud job history?

Historical run data stays in dbt Cloud. dbt-Workbench will start fresh with new run history from the point of migration. Consider exporting key metrics before switching.
