# AI Copilot Overview

dbt-Workbench includes a workspace-scoped AI copilot that supports:

- Global assistant chat panel
- SQL copilot prompts from SQL Workspace
- Lineage Q&A context prompts
- Run troubleshooting prompts from run logs
- Proposal-based SQL/dbt execution requiring explicit user confirmation

## Connectivity Modes

1. **Direct LLM API**
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Gemini

2. **MCP**
- `remote_http`
- `remote_sse`
- `local_stdio` (allowlist templates only)

## Provider Selection

- Admin sets workspace defaults.
- Optional per-session user override can be enabled.

## Execution Safety

Generated executable actions are stored as proposals and are never auto-run by default. Developers/Admins must confirm execution.
