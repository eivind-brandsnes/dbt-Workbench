# dbt lineage visualization

The **dbt lineage visualization** in dbt-Workbench provides deterministic, readable graphs so teams can trust what they see. Layouts are built with D3/dagre for consistent positioning, while controls let you explore large projects without losing context.

## Core capabilities

- **Deterministic D3/dagre layout** for consistent model placement.
- **Model + column lineage** with a shared graph experience.
- **Grouping controls** by schema, resource type, or tag.
- **Depth controls** to focus on relevant subgraphs.
- **Expand/collapse** for large DAGs.
- **Impact highlighting** for upstream and downstream changes.

## dbt lineage graph workflow

1. Start on the **Lineage** page and pick a model.
2. Expand upstream and downstream nodes to surface dependencies.
3. Turn on column lineage for deeper tracing.
4. Use grouping and depth settings to declutter the graph.

For deep column tracing, move to the [dbt column lineage](/docs/column-lineage/) page.

## FAQ

### How is the dbt lineage graph laid out?
dbt-Workbench uses a deterministic D3/dagre layout so the graph is stable between refreshes and across users.

### Can I see both model and column lineage?
Yes. Model-level lineage is available by default, and column-level lineage can be enabled for detailed tracing.

### Does the graph support grouping?
Grouping by schema, resource type, and tags is supported with collapsible aggregates.

### How do I highlight impact?
Upstream and downstream impact highlighting is available at both model and column granularity.

### What artifacts power lineage?
Lineage is derived from dbt `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` artifacts.
