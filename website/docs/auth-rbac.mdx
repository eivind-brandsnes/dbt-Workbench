# dbt RBAC and UI authentication

dbt-Workbench includes optional **dbt UI authentication** with JWT tokens and role-based access control. Authentication is disabled by default for local development and can be enabled in production deployments.

## Authentication modes

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `AUTH_ENABLED=false` (default) | No login required, all users have Admin access |
| `AUTH_ENABLED=true` | JWT-based authentication with username/password |

## Authentication endpoints (when enabled)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/auth/login` | POST | Login with username/password, returns JWT tokens |
| `/auth/refresh` | POST | Refresh access token using refresh token |
| `/auth/logout` | POST | Logout (client discards tokens) |
| `/auth/me` | GET | Get current user information |
| `/auth/switch-workspace` | POST | Switch active workspace |

## Roles & permissions

| Role | Level | Permissions |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Viewer** | 0 | Read-only access to all data |
| **Developer** | 1 | + Create/edit environments, schedules, run dbt commands |
| **Admin** | 2 | + Manage users, plugins, workspaces, global settings |

## RBAC by feature

| Feature | Viewer | Developer | Admin |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| View models, lineage, catalog | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View runs and history | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Execute dbt commands | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create/edit environments | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create/edit schedules | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Enable/disable plugins | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Manage users | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Manage workspaces | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Production checklist

- Set `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and configure `JWT_SECRET_KEY`.
- Rotate default secrets and store them in a secure secret manager.
- Enforce password policy settings for minimum length and complexity.
- Validate RBAC assignments for Viewer/Developer/Admin roles.
- Audit workspace access and confirm strict path scoping is enforced.
