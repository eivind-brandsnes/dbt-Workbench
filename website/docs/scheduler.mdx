# dbt scheduler

The **dbt scheduler** in dbt-Workbench lets you automate **cron dbt runs** with reliable dbt scheduling, diagnostics, and notifications. It is built for on-prem and air-gapped operations with explicit controls over timezones and retries.

## Scheduler capabilities

- **Cron expressions** for recurring dbt runs.
- **Timezone support** with persisted timestamps normalized to UTC.
- **Notifications** via email, Slack, or webhook.
- **Retry and backoff** policies for transient failures.
- **Overlap and catch-up policies** to avoid duplicate runs or missing data.
- **Diagnostics** for failure reasons, attempt timelines, and log/artifact links.

## Operational notes

- `SCHEDULER_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` sets the default cron evaluation timezone.
- `SCHEDULER_MAX_CATCHUP_RUNS` limits backlog runs after downtime.
- Scheduled runs inherit the dbt profile and target from their selected environment.
