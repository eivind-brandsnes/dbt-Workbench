# dbt run orchestration

The **dbt run orchestration** workflow in dbt-Workbench centralizes execution, monitoring, and artifact tracking. Run commands directly from the UI, stream logs in real time, and review artifacts on a per-run basis.

## Execution workflow

- **Execution buttons** for `dbt run`, `dbt test`, `dbt seed`, and `dbt docs generate`.
- **Live log streaming** with terminal-style output.
- **Artifacts per run** saved alongside run history.
- **Run history** with status, duration, and quick access to logs.

## Operational guardrails

- Seed-aware warnings when downstream models need fresh seeds.
- Concurrency controls via `MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`.
- Logs persist even when runs fail early to preserve error context.

## Connect to the scheduler and environments

Scheduled runs inherit dbt profiles and targets from their selected environments. Review:

- [dbt scheduler](/docs/scheduler/) for cron-based orchestration.
- [Environment management](/docs/environments/) for dbt profile settings.
