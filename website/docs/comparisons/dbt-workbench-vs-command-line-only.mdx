This page focuses on **dbt workbench vs command line dbt** and maps the decision points teams hit when scaling dbt workflows. Start with the [dbt UI guide](/docs/dbt-ui/) to align terminology, then use this page to choose an implementation pattern you can operate repeatedly.

## Why this matters

- Teams need clear ownership boundaries for lineage, run orchestration, and catalog quality.
- Security and compliance requirements often shape deployment constraints earlier than expected.
- Operating consistency reduces incident time and helps onboarding across analytics and platform teams.

## Recommended implementation path

1. Validate your baseline architecture with [Quickstart with Docker Compose](/docs/quickstart-docker/).
2. Confirm lineage requirements in [dbt lineage overview](/docs/lineage-overview/).
3. Operationalize execution in [dbt run orchestration](/docs/run-orchestration/) and [dbt scheduler](/docs/scheduler/).
4. Set catalog and docs standards through [dbt catalog viewer](/docs/catalog/) and [dbt docs viewer](/docs/docs-viewer/).
5. Secure production deployments with [dbt RBAC and authentication](/docs/auth-rbac/) and [Air-gapped and on-prem guidance](/docs/air-gapped-on-prem/).
