## Quickstart for the dbt UI

Launch dbt-Workbench locally in minutes with Docker Compose. The stack ships with a demo dbt project and sample artifacts, so you can validate lineage visualization, run orchestration, and the dbt catalog viewer on first boot.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Run the stack

```bash
docker-compose up --build
# or
docker compose up --build
```

The services will be available at:

- **UI:** http://localhost:3000
- **API:** http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs

### Mount dbt artifacts

The backend expects dbt artifacts under `./sample_artifacts`, mapped into the container as `/app/dbt_artifacts`.

```
./sample_artifacts → /app/dbt_artifacts
```

Replace `sample_artifacts` with your dbt `target/` directory containing:

- `manifest.json`
- `run_results.json`
- `catalog.json`

To enable the dbt docs viewer, include the full `dbt docs generate` output (the `index.html` and accompanying assets) inside the mounted `target/` directory. dbt-Workbench will serve that documentation site directly from the latest artifacts.

### Next steps

- Review the [dbt lineage visualization](/docs/lineage-overview/) experience.
- Set up [dbt run orchestration](/docs/run-orchestration/) and streaming logs.
- Configure the [dbt scheduler](/docs/scheduler/) for cron-driven runs.
- Explore the [dbt SQL workspace](/docs/sql-workspace/) workflow.
