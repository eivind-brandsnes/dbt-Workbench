This runbook operationalizes the 90-day SEO program for dbt-Workbench so execution stays measurable,
repeatable, and tied to GitHub growth outcomes.

## KPI scorecard

| KPI | Baseline window | Day 90 target | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| Organic clicks to docs | 14 days | +50% | Google Search Console |
| Non-brand top-10 keywords | 14 days | >=25 | Google Search Console |
| Docs pages with >100 impressions/month | 14 days | >=20 | Google Search Console |
| Docs -> GitHub outbound CTR | 14 days | >=4.5% | GA4 outbound links |
| GitHub search traffic share | 14 days | +30% | GitHub Insights |
| Net new stars | 14 days | +20-35 | GitHub Insights |

## Weekly operating cadence

1. Publish two SEO pages from the active cluster backlog.
2. Publish one external canonical post linking to one docs page and GitHub.
3. Publish one community post tied to that week’s new guide.
4. Send five outreach messages to maintainers, newsletters, or tool roundups.
5. Review KPI movement and refresh titles/descriptions for underperforming pages.

## Publishing quality gate

- Every new cluster page includes two GitHub CTAs with campaign tracking.
- Every new cluster page includes at least six internal `/docs/` links.
- Frontmatter must include `title`, `description`, `keywords`, `slug`, `seo_primary_keyword`, `seo_intent`, and `last_reviewed`.
- `npm run seo:lint` must pass before merge.
