**Example:**
```
Why I contribute to dbt-Workbench...

Last year, I struggled with dbt CLI for orchestrating runs. No visibility, manual scheduling, and painful debugging.

I found dbt-Workbench and decided to contribute instead of switching to expensive SaaS tools.

My first PR added real-time log streaming. Now teams can see dbt output as it happens - no more waiting until the end to discover errors.

What I've contributed since:
• Enhanced lineage visualization
• Built the SQL workspace
• Fixed countless bugs for production users

What I've learned:
→ Working with a distributed open-source team
• Real-world production requirements
• Designing extensible plugin systems

#DataEngineering #dbt #ProblemSolving
```

**Example:**
```
Problem I faced:
We had 5 different dbt projects managed by different teams. No central visibility, inconsistent schedules, and hard to troubleshoot across projects.

Solution: dbt-Workbench's workspace system

Now we have:
✅ One UI for all 5 projects
✅ Unified scheduling with notifications
✅ Cross-project lineage visualization
✅ Centralized run history and diagnostics

Result:
Debugging time cut by 70%
Team collaboration improved dramatically
New team members onboard 3x faster

Open-source tools make modern data engineering possible for teams of all sizes.

**Example:**
```
🎓 Quick Tip: Visualize Column-Level Lineage

Understanding which models depend on specific columns is critical for refactoring.

In dbt-Workbench:

1. Open the Lineage page
2. Click "Column Level" toggle
3. Select any column to see:
   → All upstream source columns
   → All downstream models consuming this column
   → Impact analysis before making changes

How it works:
dbt-Workbench parses manifest.json and catalog.json to build a column-level dependency graph. This helps you catch breaking changes before deployment.

🔗 https://github.com/rezer-bleede/dbt-Workbench

(I contributed to this feature)

#dbt #OpenSource #Feature
```

**Example:**
```
Excited to announce AI Copilot in dbt-Workbench! 🚀

We've integrated AI assistance directly into the UI. Generate SQL, optimize queries, debug errors, and get lineage explanations — all with natural language prompts.

Example prompt:
"Show me all models that depend on the customers table"

The AI returns:
→ Interactive lineage graph highlighting downstream models
→ SQL query to verify dependencies
→ Impact analysis for potential changes

Why this matters:
AI makes dbt more accessible to beginners and helps experienced engineers work faster. The proposal-based flow ensures you're always in control of what executes.

### Type 6: Engagement/Question
Start a conversation.

**Template:**
```
Question for data engineers: [Ask thought-provoking question]

[Share your perspective - 2-3 sentences]

This is why we built [Feature] in dbt-Workbench:
[Brief explanation]

Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇

#dbt #DataEngineering #Discussion

(Context: I contribute to dbt-Workbench)
```

**Example:**
```
Question for data engineers:

Do you prefer:
A. Building with CLI tools (full control, more complex)
B. Using GUI tools (easier, less flexible)
C. Both, depending on the task

I used to be 100% CLI. But for dbt orchestration, visual lineage and run history have been game-changers.

In dbt-Workbench, we provide both:
→ CLI for power users
→ UI for visibility and collaboration
→ API for automation

The best tool depends on the task, but having options makes teams more productive.

Would love to hear your approach! 👇

## Best Practices

### Timing
**Best times to post:**
- Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday: 8-10 AM or 5-6 PM (your audience's timezone)
- Friday: Lighter, more casual content works well
- Weekends: Lower engagement, but longer-form content can perform well

**Avoid:**
- Holidays (unless tech/developer-focused)
- Major industry conferences (unless you're posting from there)

### Frequency
- **1-2 posts per week** is ideal
- Quality over quantity - don't spam
- Space out posts about the same topic by at least 1 week

### Engagement
- **Respond to all comments** within 24 hours
- **Ask follow-up questions** to keep conversations going
- **Tag team members** when relevant (if they'd want to be tagged)
- **Share other people's content** occasionally (builds goodwill)

### Visuals
- **Use real screenshots** of dbt-Workbench UI
- **Add GIFs** for demos (Loom, ScreenToGif)
- **Create diagrams** for technical concepts (Figma, Draw.io)
- **Stock photos sparingly** - prefer real images

### Hashtags
**Use 3-5 relevant hashtags:**
```
#dbt #DataEngineering #OpenSource #AnalyticsEngineering #SQL
```
**Mix broad and specific:**
- Broad: `#dbt #DataEngineering #OpenSource`
- Specific: `#DataLineage #SQLWorkspace #AirGappedDeployment`

---

## What to Avoid

### ❌ Don't
- Copy-paste marketing copy directly from company posts
- Overuse hashtags (more than 5-7 is spammy)
- Post without disclosing your involvement
- Make claims you can't back up
- Ignore negative comments (respond professionally)
- Post competitor comparisons (keep it positive)
- Share confidential or unreleased information
- Post when frustrated or emotional (take 24h to cool off)

### ⚠️ Be Careful With
- Technical jargon (explain concepts for broader audience)
- Humor (what's funny to you might not land)
- Controversial topics outside of tech (avoid)
- Over-promoting (mix in other content too)
